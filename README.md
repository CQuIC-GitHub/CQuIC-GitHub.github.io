Git Workflow
=============
For simplicity of management, we ask that users abide by the following workflow: 

* The master branch represents the branch for which the website is **fully operational** and provides a good user experience. Under no circumstances should you merge directly into the master branch.
* Instead, merge your branch into the development branch, and we will preview those changes before merging into the master branch ourselves.
